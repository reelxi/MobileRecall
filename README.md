Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. 
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests
